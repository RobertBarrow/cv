# Letter of application

## Technical Account Director ~ Strategy, Design and Build (Centre of Excellence)

    Dear sir or madam,

    I would like to apply for the role of Technical Account Director for the new "Strategy, Design and build" Centre of Excellence at MMT Digital.

    Whilst performing the role of Technical Account Lead for the past two years, I have observed and absorbed the ways of working at MMT Digital and the processes by which we deliver digital transformation and solutions, manage risks and provide governance and oversight to our accounts.  I have also deepened my knowledge of web technologies, web development and experience design disciplines and learned a lot about the makeup of both delivery and operational teams, and the processes and tools that these teams use to interact with one another.  
    
    During my tenure, I have had frequent opportunity to cover for my line manager in certain meetings and situations, having to think and act on behalf of a Technical Account Director.  As such, I feel that I have learned some of what it takes to perform that role within our core business.  This has included the interviewing and onboarding of new Technical Account Leads and Technical Product Owners and regularly making tough decisions regarding the resourcing of my own accounts for the benefit of the wider team.

    I feel that I am now ready for a new challenge and would consider taking on such a role as the next step in my career at MMT Digital.

    Being from a product development background myself, I strongly believe that the system of people, processes, technologies and tools that are used to deliver solutions are in fact a product in their own right and should be given at least equal standing when making investment decisions at the portfolio level. We have always known this at MMT Digital, however, we have come to realise that is no longer good enough to say that we are agile (and deliver using Scrum or SAFe) when talking to prospective clients... everyone is saying the same thing in their pitches.  We therefore need a strong product offering that makes us stand out from the crowd; especially in the design and build space.  I would love to help MMT Digital develop the digital solution delivery product known as 'Engine' and to help our new business team leverage this product as one of our unique selling points for both the "Strategy, Design and Build" and "Enterprise" centres of excellence.

    This is something that I know cannot be done successfully alongside my current workload, however, I believe that, whilst performing the role of Technical Account Director, I would be afforded the necessary time, resource, agency and empowerment to enable this type of internal product investment to bear fruit.

    Kind regards,

    Robert Barrow
